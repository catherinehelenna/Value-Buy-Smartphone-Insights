# Welcome to Creating Value-Buy Smartphone : Insights from Leading Brand Project

This program explores the existing smartphone products with price range from 1 to 5 million IDR to create a new smartphone product with similar features. A smartphone company wants to develop a new, value-buy smartphone to customers by identifying which smartphone features are available within that price range.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Case Study:
A lot of Indonesian citizens are tech-lovers; they just cannot resist the temptation of changing their smartphones periodically when a new version has been released. Some considerations to get a new smartphone include design, camera, and specs. With that being said, current smartphones are increasing in variety, fulfilling market demands based on affordability. As the saying goes, there is a price for a value, customers still would like to purchase a value-buy smartphone so it would not bring too much financial problems.

Your company, X, would like to innovate a new smartphone product with a reasonable quality and price so it can label the product as "value buy" for the next release campaign. Your company has been producing smartphones for economic level (price range from 0.5 to 1 million IDR) and wondering to set up a slightly higher price to gain more revenue with its brand new product.

As a data analyst working in company X, you should dig more information about other smartphone brands so you can help your company figuring out what are key features it should include in its new product and how to set up a good price

#### What can you do with this data?

#### Conclusion from the study

It is possible, however, challenging to sell a new smartphone brand with price range from 1 to 5 million IDR online considering the reasons:

- The current market share is already highly dominated by the famous brands: VIVO and OPPO. The other brands which came after VIVO and OPPO could only take 13.9% of the total market share for selling similar smartphones.

- Depending on the company's budget, the company needs to consider which key features need to be included in their products so they can sell within the reasonable price range, that is from 2.2 to 2.5 million IDR.

- The company needs to consider selling their new product through other platforms both offline and online to extend their market reach for introducing a new product. In instance, participate in pop-up shops or events, collaborate with social media influencers, in-store promotions can be stimulative for introducing new product to the market.. For strategic locations to sell smartphones online, Jakarta, Mojokerto, and Kab.Demak are recommended.
